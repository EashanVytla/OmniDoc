OmniDoc is a voice-to-voice AI agent designed to streamline the diagnosis of generic illness symptoms into a seamless diagnostic process. The AI agent converses with patients in a natural, intuitive manner, through voice interaction, gathering relevant health information and symptoms in real-time. It utilizes LangChain sequencing to understand the patientâ€™s responses, ask follow-up questions, and clarify symptoms. Ultimately, it generates a report, giving doctors more insight into their patients prior to seeing them.
